### Project Overview

The **Generative AI Service** is a web application built using FastAPI that leverages advanced generative AI models to create content based on user inputs. This service offers two main capabilities: text generation and image-based content generation. By utilizing Googleâ€™s powerful generative models, it allows users to input prompts for both text and image generation tasks.

The service is designed to handle user interactions efficiently and securely, with features like image uploading, text-based prompts, and combining both elements to generate creative content. Additionally, the application supports converting markdown content into rich HTML, providing an enhanced presentation for the generated responses.

This service is ideal for use cases that require AI-driven content creation, such as generating descriptive text from images, creating creative writing, and producing AI-assisted visual outputs. Whether used in an internal tool or integrated into larger systems, this service provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for generating AI-driven content.
